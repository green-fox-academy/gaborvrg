# Person

# Create a Person class with the following fields:

# And the following methods:

    # introduce(): prints out "Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender."
    # get_goal(): prints out "My goal is: Live for the moment!"

# And the following constructors:

    # Person(name, age, gender)
    # Person(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female
